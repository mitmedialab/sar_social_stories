# How to contribute

Please submit pull requests against the `develop` branch.

# Guidelines
Some things that will increase the likelihood that your pull request will be
accepted:

- Each pull request should fix just one issue.
- Make commits of logical units. Generally small is good.
- Write a [good commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).

Follow the style conventions of the source code, including:
- Wrap lines at 80 characters.
- Delete trailing whitespace.
- Use 4 space indentation (no tabs).
- Including comments explaining why and how your code works or why you changed
  what you did (not just what you did).
- Use proper spelling and punctuation in comments.
- Put comments on their own line above the code they describe.
